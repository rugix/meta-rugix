# Rugix Yocto Layers

This repository provides Yocto layers for integrating [Rugix Ctrl](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl) into a custom, [Yocto-based](https://www.yoctoproject.org) Linux distribution tailored to your embedded device.
Rugix Ctrl **enables secure and efficient over-the-air (OTA) updates and provides robust state management capabilities** designed to streamline the development and maintenance of embedded Linux devices at scale.
Rugix Ctrl is part of the [Rugix Project](https://rugix.org).

Rugix Ctrl is a state-of-the-art update and state management engine:

- **A/B Updates**: Atomic system updates with automatic rollback on failure.
- **Delta Updates**: [Highly-efficient delta updates](https://rugix.org/blog/efficient-delta-updates) minimizing bandwidth.
- **Signature Verification**: Cryptographic verification _before_ installing anything anywhere.
- **State Management**: Flexible state management inspired by container-based architectures.
- **Application Updates**: Atomic deployment and rollback of [application workloads](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl/application-updates/).
- **Vendor-Agnostic**: Compatible with [various fleet management solutions](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl/advanced/fleet-management) (avoids lock-in).
- **Flexible Boot Flows**: Supports [any bootloader and boot process](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl/advanced/boot-flows).

Rugix Ctrl supports different update strategies (symmetric A/B, asymmetric with recovery, incremental updates) and can be adapted to almost any requirements you may have for robust and secure updates.

For details, check out [Rugix Ctrl's documentation](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl) and the [documentation on the Yocto layers](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl/advanced/yocto-integration/).

## Supported Yocto Versions

We only support Yocto LTS releases and maintain a dedicated branch for each (e.g., `scarthgap`, `kirkstone`). The `main` branch tracks the latest supported LTS release. Non-LTS Yocto releases are not officially supported.

## Getting Started

We provide [kas](https://github.com/siemens/kas)-based [examples](./examples/) to help you get started quickly.

## Provided Layers

The layer [`meta-rugix-core`](./meta-rugix-core/) provides everything required for installing Rugix Ctrl and building Rugix-compatible update bundles.
In addition the following board-specific layers (Rugix BSP layers) are provided:

- [`meta-rugix-rpi-tryboot`](./meta-rugix-rpi-tryboot/): BSP layer for Raspberry Pi with [`tryboot`](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#fail-safe-os-updates-tryboot)-based A/B updates (official A/B update mechanism of Raspberry Pi). This requires Raspberry Pi 4 (CM4, Raspberry Pi 400) or newer.
- [`meta-rugix-rpi-uboot`](./meta-rugix-rpi-uboot/): BSP layer for Raspberry Pi with U-Boot-based A/B updates. This is meant as a reference implementation. For actual field deployments, always use the `tryboot` integration.
- [`meta-rugix-qemu-arm64-uboot`](./meta-rugix-qemu-arm64-uboot/): BSP layer for QEMU ARM64 with U-Boot-based A/B updates.
- [`meta-rugix-qemu-x86_64-grub`](./meta-rugix-qemu-x86_64-grub/): BSP layer for QEMU x86_64 with GRUB EFI-based A/B updates.

The board-specific layers serve as **examples** for how to integrate Rugix Ctrl with specific boards and boot flows.
Depending on your project and requirements, you may need to adapt those layers or write your own.

## Rugix BSP Layers

A Rugix BSP layer configures the image build for a specific target, defining how the disk is partitioned, how the system boots, and what additional packages are required. A BSP layer typically provides:

- **WKS file** for the disk/partition layout.
- **Rugix configuration** via `system.toml` (boot flow, slots) and `bootstrapping.toml` (first-boot bootstrapping).
- **Slot mapping** defining which WIC partitions correspond to update slots (`RUGIX_SLOTS`).
- **`packagegroup-rugix-bsp`** with additional required packages (bootstrapping tools, system configuration, etc.).
- **Bootloader recipes** for target-specific boot artifacts (e.g., GRUB EFI image, U-Boot boot script).

Not all of these are required. For instance, a BSP that uses an external bootstrapping mechanism can omit the bootstrapping configuration (`bootstrapping.toml`) and the associated packages.

**How it works.** The BSP layer's `layer.conf` sets standard Yocto variables with machine overrides:

```bitbake
WKS_FILE:my-machine ?= "my-target.wks"
WKS_FILE_DEPENDS:append:my-machine = " efi-boot-image"
RUGIX_SLOTS:my-machine ?= "system:2"
IMAGE_INSTALL:append:my-machine = " packagegroup-rugix-bsp"
```

- **`WKS_FILE`** sets the WKS file for the disk layout. Override in `local.conf` to use a custom layout.
- **`WKS_FILE_DEPENDS`** declares build-time dependencies of the WKS file.
- **`RUGIX_SLOTS`** maps slot names to WIC partition numbers (e.g., `"system:2"` or `"boot:2 system:4"`).

**Creating a BSP layer.** To create a Rugix BSP layer for a new board, start from one of the provided BSP layers and adapt it. See the [Rugix documentation](https://rugix.org/docs/ctrl/advanced/boot-flows) for the available boot flows and configuration options.
